                            <h3 style="text-align: center;">What about Merdeka 118?</h3>


                            <b>The Building’s Shape</b>
                            <p><li>
                             The skyscraper won’t be looking like any generic building. The shape of the tower resembles the silhouette of Tunku Abdul Rahman when he raised his right hand and chanted the word “Merdeka!” 7 times on 31 August 1957. Hence, the long pole on the peak of the tower mimics Tunku Abdul Rahman’s outstretched hand.

                             The building is shaped like a diamond facets to resemble the diverse people of Malaysia.

                             </p></li>

                             <b>The Mystery Behind The Tower’s Name </b>

							 <p><li>Merdeka in English means Independence, so the name of the tower is to celebrate Malaysia’s liberation. The tower overlooks Stadium Merdeka and Stadium Negara, hence the name Merdeka 118.The number ‘118’ essentially represents the tower having 118 floors.</p></li>

							<p>There are 3 phases to complete the entirety of the Merdeka 118 development.
                             Phase 1 of the development is the Merdeka 118 the tower itself whereas Phase 2 is the Mederka @ 118 retail mall and the Merdeka Boulevard @ 118 linear park. Both of these phases will be completed in 2022. While Phase 3, the three residential towers surrounding the Merdeka 118 tower, will be completed in 2024.</p>

							<b>The Tippy-Top Of The Building</b>
                              <p><li>To get to the top floors of the building, you won’t be getting into any ordinary lift. The exterior lift at Merdeka118 tower has a full-height glass panel of the elevators for people to enjoy the view outside as they go up. Plus, it would only take 65 seconds to get from the ground to the top.</p></li>
                              <dl>At the top of the tower will have an Observation Deck. The Observation Deck also happens to be the highest in Southeast Asia. You can see the view of the entire Kuala Lumpur city from 500m height.</dl>

							<b>The Night View Of The Tower </b>

							<p><li>During the night, the skyscraper will light up the sky with its amazing lighting strips that will move across from corner to corner. This will definitely give the building an extraordinary and futuristic look compared to the other buildings around Kuala Lumpur.</p></li>

							<b>The Genius Behind The Making Of This Tower</b>

							<p><li>Fender Katsalidis the Australia based architect firm turned its vision to reality in creating this magnificent tower in our beloved city. It’s no surprise how amazing this creation is considering the company also created Eureka Tower, the tallest building in Australia. The Fender Katsalidis Architects also contributed to providing luxury housing projects in Taman Duta, Kuala Lumpur.</p></li>
