							<p><b>Introduction</b>
								<li>The Shanghai Tower, situated in the Lujiazui area of Shanghai, China, is a breathtaking architectural masterpiece that stands as the tallest building in China and the second-tallest in the world, surpassed only by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.</li>
							<dl>Soaring to a height of 632 meters (2,073 feet) with 128 floors above ground and 5 below, the tower boasts a distinctive twisting design that is both aesthetically captivating and functionally innovative. Its double-skin facade not only adds to its visual appeal but also enhances energy efficiency by providing insulation and reducing wind loads.</dl></p>

                            <b>Let's explore more!</b>
							<p>Opened to the public in 2016, Shanghai Tower is one of the world’s most impressive architectural marvels. Rising above the city’s financial district, it represents a green future for China. A tower so tall you can only see the top on a clear day, the Shanghai Tower is known for its height, but that is only the beginning of the story.</p>
							<p>
                            <dl>It has the world’s highest observation deck.
                            Skyscraper fans and those who want an unbeatable view can’t do much better than the observation deck of the Shanghai Tower, located on the 121st floor. At 561.3 meters (1841.5 feet), the deck is the highest in the world, offering viewers a godlike perspective of Lujiazui and the Huangpu River.</dl>

                             </p>


							<b>Fun Facts!</b>
							<p><li>Its elevators are the fastest in the world</li>
                               <dl>If you’re worried about a long trip to the top, fret no more. Designed by Mitsubishi, the elevators in Shanghai Tower are the fastest in the world, traveling at speeds of 74 km/h (45.9 mph). That’s faster than the speed limit of most in town roads!</dl>

                               <li>It is state owned</li>
                               <dl>The tower is owned by Yeti Construction and Development, a coalition of state owned development companies like Shanghai Lujiazui Finance & Trade Zone Development Co. and Shanghai Construction Group. Funding for construction came in part from Shanghai’s municipal government, with the total cost coming in at RMB16.5 billion ($2.4 billion).</dl>

							<li>It has nine zones and environmentally friendly</li>
                               <dl>The tower is formed from the stacking of nine cylindrical buildings. Each of these nine zones contains a separate atrium, featuring gardens, cafes, and retail space. From the outside, the nine zones are impossible to see, as the entire structure is encased in a transparent glass facade.</dl>
                               <dl>The Shanghai Tower is an encouraging symbol of China’s new commitment to environmental friendliness. It incorporates several green architectural elements and was praised by its design firm as “the greenest super high-rise building on earth.” For example, the 120° twist is intended to reduce wind loads on the building by 24%, allowing the construction team to use 25% less structural steel than a non green design of an equal height.</dl>

							<p><li>Designer</li>
							 <dl>The architectural firm behind its design is American, but its chief architect is Chinese
                               Shanghai Tower was designed by American architectural firm Gensler, whose other notable projects include JFK International Airport and the Houston Ballet Centre for Dance. However, the design team was led by Jun Xia, who was born and raised in Shanghai and received his architectural training from Tongji University, located in, you guessed it, Shanghai.</dl></p>

							<p><li>It has two “sister towers.”</li>
                               <dl>The tower is totally unique in its design, but city plans from 1993 reveal that it was intended as one of three super tall towers all located in the Lujiazui financial district on the east bank of the Huangpu River. The other two were completed before Shanghai Tower, Jin Mao Tower which opened in 1999, and the Shanghai World Financial Center, which opened in 2008.</dl></p>
